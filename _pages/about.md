A friend of mine writes short stories. Another friend (I think) writes poems. One day I thought maybe i can also write about my experiences which to be honest can be very entertaining sometimes.

While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. 
So well tada, using a custom theme here is my very own blog. Feel free to comment on anything you feel deserves appreciation.


Thanks for reading!
