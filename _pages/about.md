A friend of mine writes short stories. Another friend (I think) writes poems. One day I thought maybe i can also write about my experiences which to be honest can be very entertaining sometimes.

On sep 3rd, 2020, which was my 24th Birthday, I realized how much I can improve my life. I set out on a one year journey to improve my life. My goal is to pick one area of my life every month and create a system to improve and sustain the quality of that particular aspect. 
So well tada, I hope I inspire you to embark on a similar journey towards actualizing a life that you desire.

 So well,here is my very own blog. Feel free to comment on anything you feel deserves appreciation.


Thanks for reading!
