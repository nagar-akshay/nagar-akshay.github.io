Ain't it the cold windy month of january,
When the people drink, turn sluggish and are merry,
Met her in a restaurant where ketchup is free ,
Feelings overcast with heartbreaks,  there was no guarantee
My mind free of any expectation last time I checked,
then I lay my eyes upon her outside the cafe I stood corrected,
I hadnt thought I would be blown away,
The girl, I saw was too good to be true she was born to slay, 
so I went in the cafe straightaway,
She came in and yeah I was blown away,
Not by her beauty but by her eyes,
She was quite different and mysterious you guys,
but so is quantum physics, I like both ofcourse   
We chatted until the evening ran its course,
Had an icecream, a burger, and stories manyfold,
However I had a feeling about some things untold,


An unknown kid ran by us,(his condition)a byproduct of capitalism,
She turned towards him, I stared in skepticism,
She asked about his education and,his family's condition,
And here was I dumbstruck by her affection,
I fell for her , my pupils underwent dilation ,


So I ask you O wise reader,
is there a way for doors of affection to open,
Or will I always be heartbroken?
