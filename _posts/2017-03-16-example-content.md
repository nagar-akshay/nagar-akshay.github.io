I have recently started on making a new app in a team of 5 for an NGO which caters to the needs of socially and emotional needs of children and gamifies the whole concept.
Honestly Speaking the whole concept was really different and is the first time in history as the content can be changed anytime by the NGO without any developer.
This would serve almost 2 lakh children globally. I feel such initiatives will really help in nurturing the lives of children in rural background and help in their development.
I would love for all of you to checkout the app when its done.
Maybe I will update its link.
