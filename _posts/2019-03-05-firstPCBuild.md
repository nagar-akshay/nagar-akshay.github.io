I always had this dream of building my own PC one day. It is infact the dream of any person who plays above average number of games in their life.

I used to have this Windows 98 PC as a kid in which I had only this games of Dave,CD man and prince of persia which was somehow my favourite at the time.
I also didnt have internet so it just seemed that DAVE was the epitome of the gaming world at the time.

Some years later when i was i think 12 i came across one of my rich friends having a game called motocross madness installed in his PC which was so different that it blew my mind.
I was kinda dumbfounded that the game had so many graphics, I being naive immediately got his game in a CD(so long ago this seems) then tried to install it on my PC. And loo I was taken aback when it said that my Windows version does not support it.

Thats when I think my real appreciation of Windows and how software works started i think. I read so much about Windows that day which I never would have done without it.
Gaming can help you to know a lot more about your computer and its hardware than I ever had.
  
So I built my first assembled PC yesterday with all the latest parts I could get from the market at SP road banaglore). I got my transparent RGB cabinet ordered from amazon,
my Graphics card is an AMD Ryzen 2600 16GB,RGB RAM 16GB, motherboard is ms 7S38 which is the fastest right now. I have also got a backlit keyboard, 2 24 inch monitors, 5 fans.
 I also somehow got Creative speaker 2.1 and mousepad for free. All of this for 72k . Not a bad deal  at all 

Now my PC is far from perfect for a gaming PC but it will definitely run the the most demanding games easily.
 
Next stop --> Hackintosh
