So I have always been a rather ardent follower of astrophysics books and theories, completing Feynmann's books in 2nd year of college.
 I thought I will pen down some of the most interesting things I have explored here.
Recently I came across this book called ASTROPHYSICS FOR PEOPLE IN A HURRY and its just amazing.
It was written by Neil deGrasse Tyson,an astrophysicist, who most of you would recall from Cosmos: a space odyssey.
It is kinda fun and witty clearly written for people who dont want to dwelve on the mathematics or the existential crisis thinking about cosmos sometimes imbibes in you.

Rather it is just a light take on the entire matter just like how the tv series was , I would recommend all amateurs to read it once.
