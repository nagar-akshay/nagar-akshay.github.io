I woke up today abruptly today around 4 am. I remember now , I slept  early, way too early,yesterday because of having an early trading session today.
Trading and profits. Tch Tch, I horrifyingly think of how materialistic I have become.

This was also because unlike most people I have had no interest now in celebrating another round around the sun. Majorly, as I reasoned to myself, because the previous 
year had not been very interesting or happy one to warrant another year's celebration.

However , as I scrolled past the various messages I had received, it brought for the first time, in a long time, a genuine smile to my face. 

The past year had been tough, I recalled gloomily, with invariably mounting work pressure, pressure to succeed and differet facets of life not to mention the obvious challenges of living in 2020. 

However despite all that I surmised I made new friends in the last year and had a lot of memories and fun moments over virtual media, although the friendship itself was very real. 

Maybe 2020 wasn't so uninteresting after all.
A lot of people who would have ignored each other have become friends and some sort of bond has formed even though the reason may have been boredom or something else.

Maybe there is reason to celebrate, not just because in hope of having an exciting new year but to also to welcome new relationships which each year has had invariably brought forward.

Maybe it is a Happy new year everyone!!!
